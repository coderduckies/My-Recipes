		<h2>Crispy Qusadilla</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>A single corn tortilla</li>
			<li>Some shredded cheese</li>
		</ul>
		<ol>
			<li>Lightly oil pan. Warm torilla over medium-high heat. Flip when soft and floppy.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle that delicious shredded cheese on half of the tortilla.</li>
			<li>Fold tortilla, lifting the non-cheese side. I mean, you totally could lift the cheesy side, I'm not going to report you, but why? Why would you make such a decision? Who are you trying to impress with your actions? You are alone, in your apartment, making a single quesodilla, you don't need to ruin this experience with your reckless decisions. </li>
			<li>Cook until <strong>crispy</strong>. Flip. Cook until <strong>crispy</strong>. Cool. Enjoy.</li>
